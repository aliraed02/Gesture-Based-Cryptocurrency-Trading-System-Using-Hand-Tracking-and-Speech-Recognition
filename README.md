# Gesture-Based Cryptocurrency Trading System

## Overview

Welcome to the "Gesture-Based Cryptocurrency Trading System" project! This system combines hand tracking and speech recognition to enable users to make cryptocurrency trades through gestures and voice commands. The system interprets hand gestures for trading actions (buy/sell) and uses speech recognition for user interaction.
